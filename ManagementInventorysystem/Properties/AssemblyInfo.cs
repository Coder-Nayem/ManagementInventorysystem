[assembly: AssemblyDescription("Inventory management systems are software tools that help businesses track inventory levels, orders, sales and deliveries. They can be used in manufacturing plants, warehouses, retail stores and restaurants. The best inventory management software syncs in real time, ensuring seamless transactions whether your customers shop online or in your store. However, the needs of retail shops or restaurants differ from those of a small manufacturing plant, so it’s vital to pick the right tools for your business.")]
